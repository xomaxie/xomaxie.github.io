# FEDoc - Farming Game Engine Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to **FEDoc**, the official documentation for the Farming Game Engine built using **Unreal Engine 5.6** in **C++**.  
This engine powers a farming game focusing on inventory management, resource harvesting, player stats, and interactive environmental elements.

---

## Core Systems

### Inventory System

- **InventoryComponent**  
  Manages inventory logic including adding, removing, and item stacking.  
  Fires events on inventory changes to update UI.

- **InventorySlot**  
  Handles logic for item stacking and updating individual slots.

- **InventoryWidget / InventorySlotWidget**  
  Provides visual representation and interactive UI for inventory management.  
  Supports drag-and-drop item movement and quick access.

### Player Character

- **FarmerCharacter**  
  Central pawn class for the player, integrating input handling for movement, interactions, harvesting, and combat.  
  Utilizes **StatsComponent** for managing player attributes such as health and stamina.

- **FarmerController**  
  Custom controller managing player input, camera systems, and interaction logic.

### Game Management

- **GM_Farm**  
  Core gameplay manager responsible for maintaining overall game state, including player spawning and initialization.

### Items & Resources

- **ItemData**  
  Data-driven approach defining properties for each in-game item, such as icons, stack limits, and interactions.

- **DroppedItem / DroppedTreeLoot**  
  Represents physical items spawned in-world, collectible by player interaction after harvesting or resource depletion.

### Environment & Interaction

- **TreeActor**  
  Represents trees in-game, serving as harvestable resources.  
  Implements the `DamageableInterface` to facilitate harvesting mechanics.

- **DamageableInterface**  
  Standardized interface for destructible or interactive resources, streamlining interaction logic.

### Player Stats & Damage

- **StatsComponent**  
  Manages player-specific attributes including health, stamina, damage calculation, and healing.  
  Notifies relevant systems when stats change, enabling dynamic gameplay and UI updates.

## Workflow

### Inventory Management

- Collect item → Spawn as `DroppedItem` → Player interaction → Added to `InventoryComponent` → UI (`InventoryWidget`) updated automatically.

### Resource Harvesting

- Interact with `TreeActor` → Apply damage via `DamageableInterface` → Resource depleted → Spawn `DroppedTreeLoot` → Collect loot → Inventory updated.

### Player Stats Interaction

- Player actions modify `StatsComponent` → Health/Stamina updated → UI and gameplay reflect changes dynamically.

## Roadmap

Upcoming enhancements:

- Crafting system.
- Additional resource types (rocks, minerals).
- Advanced combat mechanics with enemy AI.
- Farming mechanics (crop planting, growth management).
- UI/UX improvements with polished interactions.
- Comprehensive audio integration (environment, actions, feedback).
